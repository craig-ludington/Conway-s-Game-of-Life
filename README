# conway

A functional version of Conway's Game of Life for an infinite board.

## Usage
Define a world as a set of coordinates, where each coordinate is a vector of two integers.
Pass that world as a parameter to new-world.
A new world will be returned.
Repeat forever.

Example:
   (new-world #{ [-1 0] [0 0] [1 0] })
   => #{[0 -1] [0 0] [0 1]}
